# Flux in 5 Minutes

# GitOps

# Flux does GitOps

# How

# How Flux does GitOps

(Context Diagram showing User, GitHub, GitRepository, Kustomization, Receiver, and Subscriptions between all of these)

You get independent configuration, control, and observability of those resources via metrics

# GitOps GA

# What is GitOps GA?

GitRepository, Kustomization, v1 APIs

Notifications APIs (`Alert`, `Provider`, `Event`)

# Flux 2.0

# What else is new in Flux 2.0?

* SLSA Build Level 3
* Workload Identity with OCI
* Sharding & horizontal scaling

# Automation

* Flux Image Automation
  * Sequentially numbered images
* Flux OCIRepository Artifact
  * `flux push artifact` - whole manifest
* SemVer Sources Automation
  * for tagged workloads

# Native Helm

# Unparalleled Helm support

* Helm SDK under the hood
* Post-render Kustomizations make modding Helm charts easy
* Drift Correction feature now (behind Feature Gate)
* `HelmRepository` with oci

# Ecosystem

* You might already be using Flux and not even know it
* Flux is under the hood:
  * GitLab Agent, EKS Anywhere, Azure Arc

# Partners in Industry

* Ecosystem of infrastructure vendors supporting Flux
* `microsoft.flux` Extension, AWS (EKSctl), GitLab, and more
* ... all embed Flux in their Kubernetes + CD platforms

# Adopters

* Enterprises have been trusting Flux for a long time
* SAP, RingCentral, Volvo
* Telecoms, Banks/Financial Institutions, Universities
* Many institutions have trusted Flux for years

# Ecosystem and Community

* Weave GitOps OSS
* VSCode GitOps Tools Extension (by Weaveworks)
* Many Third-party UIs

# Ecosystem and Community

* Shout out to Paid support available
* Weave GitOps Enterprise

# 4. Flux GA is loaded with news

SLSA Build Level 3 - compliance and provenance verification, protection against tampering
GitOps GA Milestone - stable (v1) APIs for Fluxâ€™s core GitOps features and notifications API brings added clarity for platform teams, infra vendors about stability & guarantees.
Workload Identity - integrated with Fluxâ€™s OCIRepository sources - security, ease of use wrt handling secrets (use passwordless/ambient environment credentials)
v2.0 Flux introduces the horizontal sharding & scaling capability for maintaining service level on v. XL Flux installations
Performance improvements including especially Helm, and Helm-upgrade drift detection
