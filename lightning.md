# How Flux does GitOps

(Context Diagram showing User, GitHub, GitRepository, Kustomization, Receiver, and Subscriptions between all of these)

You get independent configuration, control, and observability of those resources via metrics

# 4. Flux GA is loaded with news

SLSA Build Level 3 - compliance and provenance verification, protection against tampering
GitOps GA Milestone - stable (v1) APIs for Fluxâ€™s core GitOps features and notifications API brings added clarity for platform teams, infra vendors about stability & guarantees.
Workload Identity - integrated with Fluxâ€™s OCIRepository sources - security, ease of use wrt handling secrets (use passwordless/ambient environment credentials)
v2.0 Flux introduces the horizontal sharding & scaling capability for maintaining service level on v. XL Flux installations
Performance improvements including especially Helm, and Helm-upgrade drift detection
